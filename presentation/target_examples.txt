[Target Analysis Examples]

2. Staff Service Analysis
Targets: "staff", "service", "employee"
Sample Review:
"The front desk staff were extremely helpful and friendly. However, the restaurant service was slow, and some staff seemed untrained. The concierge gave excellent recommendations for local attractions."

3. Location Analysis
Targets: "location", "area", "vicinity"
Sample Review:
"The hotel's location is perfect for shopping and dining, right in the city center. Public transport is nearby, though the street noise can be a bit much at night. The surrounding area feels safe and well-maintained."

4. Facilities Analysis
Targets: "facilities", "amenities", "equipment"
Sample Review:
"The gym facilities are modern and well-maintained, but the pool was too small. The business center needs updating, especially the printers. The spa facilities were excellent though."

Sample Review:
"Breakfast was disappointing with limited options and cold food. The hotel restaurant serves decent dinner but is overpriced. Room service menu is quite limited but the quality is good."

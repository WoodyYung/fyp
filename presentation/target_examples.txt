1. Target: iPhone, battery, screen, features
Review: The iPhone camera quality is outstanding, but the battery is disappointing. The screen is crystal clear and the new features are amazing.

2. Target: waiter, food, manager
Review: The waiter was rude and inattentive. We waited for 45 minutes just to get our drinks. The food came out cold and when we complained about the service, the manager didn't care.

3. Target: pizza, crust, sauce, seasoning
Review: This pizza place serves the best pizza in town! The crust is perfectly crispy and the sauce has just the right amount of seasoning. Even their cheese pizza is delicious.

4. Target: laptop, processor, keyboard, trackpad
Review: I bought this laptop last week, and I have mixed feelings about it. The processor is fast and efficient, but the keyboard feels cheap and the trackpad isn't responsive enough.

5. Target: movie, plot, characters
Review: While the special effects in the movie were breathtaking, the plot was confusing and the characters were poorly developed. The acting performances saved some scenes, but overall it wasn't worth the ticket price.
